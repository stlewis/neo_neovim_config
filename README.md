## My NeoVim Configuration

This is just a place to keep my NeoVim configuration so that it is easily accessible to me. As a reminder, the steps for going from absolute zero to a working NeoVim with this configuration are:

1. Ensure you have a recent version of NeoVim installed. As of this writing, the latest available is 0.10.3.

2. Clone this repository to your `~/.config/nvim` directory.

3. Start NeoVim. This should kick off Lazy.nvim to install all of the plugins and then load the configuration.
